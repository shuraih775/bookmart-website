## Important Note: 
                 -> Admin needs to be created manually. If you are directly entering a document in the users collection to create admin don't 
                    forget to hash the password before entering the document. Or else (easy way) just register the admin as regular user
                    and then go to your users collection edit the document and assign true to isAdmin.
                 
                 -> don't forget to change all the requests(links) on the admin and client side, to the to the address where your server is  
                    hosted.

                 -> also change the the connection string to the mongodb server.(in server/config/db.js)

                 -> change the link to the admin side(in server/controllers/auth.js)
